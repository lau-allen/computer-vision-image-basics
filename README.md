Computer Vision: Basic Image Operations 
==============================
## Computer Vision Topics: Pinhole Camera, Thin Lens Camera, Basic Digital Image Operations

This repository contains material exploring the concepts of the pinhole camera and thin lens models. Additionally, MATLAB code is used to perform basic image operations like:
* reading and displaying an image 
* generating an intensity image 
* linear and logarithmic quantization of the intensity and colored image 

NOTE: The ID Picture used in the report is purposefully blurred to maintain the anonymity of the person. An alternative picture is stored in the images/ folder so the code can be successfully ran.
